/**
 * A "result file" is a file format used to store approximation sets along with any associated metadata.

 * 
 * In this example, we store the results from solving UF1 with NSGA-II with various population sizes, then
 * compute the hypervolume metric for those results. Try running this example multiple times to see it resume
