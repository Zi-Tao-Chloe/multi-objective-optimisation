# Setup

## Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK).  For Windows, we recommend either
[Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) or [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk).  Linux users
with Apt can run `sudo apt install default-jdk`.

Download and install the latest version of Eclipse from http://eclipse.org.

## Setting up a Java Project

Download the the compiled binaries from either our website at http://moeaframework.org or the
[Releases page](https://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework/releases).  After extracting the download, select
`File > Open Projects from File System` and open the extracted directory.  Once imported, you should see
the following in the package explorer:

## Running Examples

The examples are contained in the `examples/` directory.  Navigate to the `examples > (default package)`
to view the introductory examples:

Right-click on an example and select `Run As > Java Application`.  You should soon see output appearing in the
console.  Congratulations, you're all set up!

### Command Line

Eclipse is not required to use the MOEA Framework - any IDE will work.  We can also run examples directly from the
command line:

```bash

java -classpath "lib/*" examples/Example1.java
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see many build errors indicating `<className> cannot be resolved to a type`, it's likely the project
was created with **modules** enabled.  To confirm, check if the file `src/module-info.java` exists:

To fix, we recommend deleting the broken project including the source directory.  Download and extract the
MOEA Framework release again, then follow the steps above to import the project.  If you are instead creating a new
Java project, be sure to uncheck the option to create `module-info.java`:
