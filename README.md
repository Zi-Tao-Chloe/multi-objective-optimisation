﻿# Multi-Objective Optimization of Charge Consumption in Android GUI

This repository focuses on multi-objective optimization of charge consumption in Android GUI applications using the MOEA Framework. The goal is to minimize both the charge consumption due to color profiles and the deviation from a defined reference color scheme.

## Task Overview
The program optimizes the color configuration of the graphical user interface (GUI) of an Android app, considering two objectives:
1. **Minimizing charge consumption**: Charge consumption due to color profiles is calculated based on the screen's OLED properties.
2. **Minimizing deviation from a reference color scheme**: Deviation is measured as the sum of Euclidean color differences for each pixel in the image.

Both objectives are handled simultaneously in the multi-objective optimization process using the MOEA Framework.

### Steps Implemented:
1. A reference color scheme is defined.
2. The objectives (charge consumption and color deviation) are formulated and passed to the MOEA Framework.
3. The program runs the NSGA-II algorithm with a population size of 20 and a computational budget of 10,000 evaluations.
4. All data needed for the scatter plots are generated by the `Optimization.java` file to visualize the trade-offs between charge consumption and color deviation.

## Running the Program

To run the program:
1. Compile and execute the `Optimization.java` file located in the `examples` directory.
2. You can run the optimization for two target applications: `simpleApp` and `calculator`.
   - To execute `simpleApp`, comment out lines 114/115 in `Optimization.java`.
   - To execute `calculator`, comment out lines 121/122 in `Optimization.java`.

The program will output the optimization results, including the charge consumption and color deviation trade-offs, in both numerical and visual form.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- MOEA Framework library (available at [http://moeaframework.org](http://moeaframework.org))


## MOEA Framework ##

The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and
experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other
general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm
optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of
algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, ε-MOEA,
GDE3, PAES, PESA2, SPEA2, IBEA, SMS-EMOA, SMPSO, OMOPSO, CMA-ES, and MOEA/D.
In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary
to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.

Its key features includes:
  * Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
  * Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
  * Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
  * Tools for building and statistically testing new optimization algorithms
  * Permissive open source license
  * Fully documented and tested source code
